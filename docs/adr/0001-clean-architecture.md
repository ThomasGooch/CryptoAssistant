# ADR 0001: Clean Architecture Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When starting the AkashTrends project, we needed to decide on an architectural pattern that would:
- Support the development of a complex real-time cryptocurrency analysis platform
- Allow for testability and maintainability
- Provide clear separation of concerns
- Enable independent evolution of different parts of the system

## Decision

We decided to implement Clean Architecture with the following layers:

1. **Core Layer**
   - Contains domain entities, value objects, and business logic
   - Has no dependencies on other layers or external frameworks
   - Defines interfaces that are implemented by outer layers

2. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Implements interfaces defined in the Core layer
   - Contains external API integrations (e.g., Coinbase)
   - Handles data persistence and external communication

3. **API Layer**
   - Provides endpoints for client applications
   - Uses dependency injection to wire up the system
   - Contains SignalR hubs for real-time communication

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear separation of concerns makes the system easier to understand and maintain
- Domain logic is isolated from implementation details
- Testing is simplified through dependency injection and interfaces
- The system can evolve more independently, with changes in one layer not necessarily affecting others

### Negative

- More initial setup and boilerplate code
- Requires discipline to maintain the architectural boundaries
- May introduce some complexity for simple features

## Compliance Verification

We've implemented architecture tests to verify adherence to Clean Architecture principles:
- Domain layer should not depend on other layers
- Infrastructure should not depend on API layer
- Services should depend on interfaces, not implementations
