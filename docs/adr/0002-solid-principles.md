# ADR 0002: SOLID Principles Adoption

## Status

Accepted

## Context

During the development of AkashTrends, we needed to establish coding principles that would ensure maintainable, extensible, and testable code. We needed guidelines that would help us create a robust architecture that could evolve over time.

## Decision

We decided to strictly adhere to SOLID principles throughout the codebase:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each class should have only one reason to change
   - Services are focused on specific functionality
   - Example: Separate services for price updates and indicator calculations

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
   - Use of interfaces and abstract classes to allow extending functionality
   - Example: Indicator factory pattern for adding new technical indicators

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
   - Consistent behavior across inheritance hierarchies
   - Example: All indicator implementations follow the same contract

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
   - Small, focused interfaces instead of large, monolithic ones
   - Example: Separate interfaces for different service responsibilities

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
   - Both should depend on abstractions
   - Example: Controllers depend on service interfaces, not implementations

## Consequences

### Positive

- More maintainable and extensible codebase
- Easier to test individual components
- Reduced coupling between components
- Clearer responsibilities for each class
- Easier to understand and modify code

### Negative

- More interfaces and classes to manage
- May increase initial development time
- Requires discipline to maintain

## Compliance Verification

We've implemented architecture tests to verify adherence to SOLID principles:
- Classes should have a single responsibility (limited method count)
- Services should depend on abstractions
- Interfaces should be focused (limited method count)
- High-level modules should depend on abstractions

## Additional Notes

We've explicitly decided against using certain libraries that might violate these principles:
- No MediatR for CQRS implementation (to maintain explicit dependencies)
- No AutoMapper for object mapping (to maintain explicit transformations)
