# ADR 0003: Test-Driven Development Approach

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When developing AkashTrends, we needed to ensure high code quality, comprehensive test coverage, and maintainable code. We needed to decide on a development methodology that would support these goals while allowing us to move quickly and confidently.

## Decision

We decided to adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD) as our primary development approach:

1. **Write Tests First**
   - Create tests before implementing functionality
   - Define expected behavior through test cases
   - Only write code necessary to make tests pass

2. **Testing Framework**
   - Use xUnit as the primary testing framework
   - Use NSubstitute for mocking dependencies
   - Follow a consistent naming pattern for tests (Should_ExpectedBehavior_When_StateUnderTest)

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Aim for comprehensive test coverage across all layers
   - Unit tests for domain logic and services
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Architecture tests for enforcing design principles

4. **Refactoring**
   - Continuously refactor code to improve design
   - Rely on tests to ensure refactoring doesn't break functionality
   - Maintain clean code through regular refactoring

## Consequences

### Positive

- Higher code quality and fewer bugs
- Better design through thinking about usage before implementation
- Documentation of expected behavior through tests
- Confidence when making changes or refactoring
- Easier onboarding for new team members

### Negative

- Initial development may be slower
- Requires discipline to write tests first
- May lead to over-testing in some areas

## Compliance Verification

We've implemented architecture tests to verify adherence to TDD principles:
- Public classes should have corresponding tests
- Test methods should follow proper naming conventions
- Test classes should have multiple tests for good coverage
- Tests should use NSubstitute for mocking (not other frameworks)

## Additional Notes

Our TDD approach specifically avoids:
- Writing tests after implementation
- Skipping tests for "simple" functionality
- Using multiple mocking frameworks
