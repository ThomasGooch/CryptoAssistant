# ADR 0005: Architecture Testing Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the AkashTrends project grows, maintaining architectural integrity becomes increasingly challenging. We needed a way to:
- Enforce clean architecture principles
- Ensure adherence to SOLID principles
- Verify proper test-driven development practices
- Prevent architectural drift over time

## Decision

We decided to implement architecture testing using NetArchTest.Rules:

1. **Dedicated Architecture Test Project**
   - Created `AkashTrends.Architecture.Tests` project
   - Separate from functional unit and integration tests
   - Focus on structural and architectural concerns

2. **Clean Architecture Validation**
   - Tests to verify layer dependencies flow correctly
   - Ensure domain layer doesn't depend on infrastructure or API
   - Verify services depend on interfaces, not implementations
   - Check that domain entities are properly immutable

3. **SOLID Principles Verification**
   - Tests for Single Responsibility Principle (class size and focus)
   - Verification of Open/Closed Principle (abstractions usage)
   - Liskov Substitution Principle checks
   - Interface Segregation tests (interface size and focus)
   - Dependency Inversion validation (high-level modules using abstractions)

4. **TDD Practice Enforcement**
   - Verify public classes have corresponding tests
   - Check test method naming conventions
   - Ensure test classes have multiple tests
   - Confirm NSubstitute usage for mocking

5. **Explicit Library Avoidance**
   - Verify no usage of MediatR (as per requirements)
   - Ensure no AutoMapper usage (as per requirements)

## Consequences

### Positive

- Architectural principles are explicitly verified
- New developers are guided by failing tests when violating principles
- Architectural decisions become executable documentation
- Prevents gradual architectural drift

### Negative

- Additional maintenance overhead for architecture tests
- Some architectural principles are difficult to test automatically
- May require occasional updates as the codebase evolves

## Implementation Approach

We've implemented the architecture tests with a gradual enforcement strategy:
- Initial tests are simplified to establish the framework
- Tests will be strengthened over time as the codebase matures
- Exceptions can be made for legacy code while enforcing rules for new code

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate architecture tests into CI/CD pipeline
- Add more specific tests for architectural patterns
- Implement custom rules for project-specific conventions
- Gradually increase the strictness of architectural validation
