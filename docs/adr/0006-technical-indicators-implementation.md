# ADR 0006: Technical Indicators Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

AkashTrends requires various technical indicators for cryptocurrency trading analysis. We needed to design a flexible, maintainable, and extensible system for implementing these indicators that would:
- Support multiple indicator types (SMA, EMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic)
- Allow for easy addition of new indicators
- Ensure consistent calculation and validation
- Work with real-time data updates

## Decision

We decided to implement technical indicators using:

1. **Interface-Based Design**
   - Created `IIndicator` interface with a `Calculate` method
   - All indicators implement this common interface
   - Strong typing for input and output parameters

2. **Factory Pattern**
   - Implemented `IIndicatorFactory` for creating indicator instances
   - Factory selects the appropriate indicator implementation based on type
   - Allows for runtime selection of indicators

3. **Immutable Value Objects**
   - Indicators return immutable `IndicatorResult` objects
   - Results contain calculated value and time range information
   - Strong validation ensures data integrity

4. **Input Validation**
   - Comprehensive validation of input data
   - Proper error handling for invalid or insufficient data
   - Clear error messages for debugging

5. **Timeframe Support**
   - Indicators can be calculated across different timeframes
   - Timeframe-specific data retrieval and calculations
   - Consistent results regardless of timeframe

## Consequences

### Positive

- Consistent interface makes indicators interchangeable
- Factory pattern simplifies adding new indicators
- Strong validation prevents calculation errors
- Immutable results prevent unintended modifications
- Flexible timeframe support enables comprehensive analysis

### Negative

- Some duplication in calculation logic across similar indicators
- Performance considerations for complex indicators with large datasets
- Need for careful testing of mathematical correctness

## Implementation Details

- Implemented indicators:
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Stochastic Oscillator

- Each indicator has:
  - Dedicated implementation class
  - Comprehensive unit tests
  - Input validation
  - Proper error handling

## Compliance Verification

The technical indicators implementation adheres to our architectural principles:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Interface-based design for extensibility
- Factory pattern for object creation
- Immutable value objects for data integrity
- Strong input validation and error handling
