# 7. Frontend Technology Stack

Date: 2025-05-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

AkashTrends requires a modern frontend framework that can handle:
- Real-time data visualization
- Complex UI components for trading analysis
- Type-safe development
- Fast development iteration
- Modern build tooling

## Decision

We have decided to use:

1. React with TypeScript
   - React for its mature ecosystem and component model
   - TypeScript for type safety and improved maintainability
   - Strong community support and extensive libraries

2. Vite as the build tool
   - Faster development server compared to Create React App
   - Better hot module replacement
   - Modern ESM-based approach
   - Optimized production builds

3. Development tooling
   - ESLint for code quality
   - Vitest for unit testing
   - React Testing Library for component testing
   - TailwindCSS for styling

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Development efficiency
   - Fast refresh during development
   - Strong IDE support with TypeScript
   - Quick build times with Vite

2. Code quality
   - Type safety catches errors early
   - Consistent code style with ESLint
   - Comprehensive testing capabilities

3. Future-proof
   - Modern stack with active development
   - Easy to find developers familiar with React
   - Good upgrade path for future React versions

### Negative

1. Learning curve
   - Team needs TypeScript knowledge
   - Vite configuration different from CRA
   - TailwindCSS learning curve for CSS-focused developers

2. Build complexity
   - More configuration needed compared to CRA
   - Need to manage TypeScript configuration
   - Potential version conflicts between tools

## Notes

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Document any custom build configurations
- Maintain TypeScript strict mode
- Consider creating shared component library as codebase grows
