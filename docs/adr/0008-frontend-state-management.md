# 8. Frontend State Management

Date: 2025-05-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

AkashTrends needs to manage various types of state:
- Real-time cryptocurrency prices
- Technical indicator calculations
- UI state and user preferences
- WebSocket connection status

For the MVP phase, we needed to decide whether to use React's built-in state management or introduce an external state management library.

## Decision

We have decided to use React's built-in state management for the MVP:

1. Component-level state
   - useState for local component state
   - useEffect for side effects and data fetching
   - useCallback and useMemo for performance optimization

2. Custom hooks for shared logic
   - useSignalR for WebSocket management
   - Centralized connection handling
   - Reusable subscription patterns

3. Props for component communication
   - Clear parent-child relationships
   - Explicit data flow
   - Callback props for child-to-parent communication

4. Context API when needed
   - Reserved for truly global state
   - Used sparingly to avoid unnecessary re-renders
   - Limited to cross-cutting concerns

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Simplicity
   - No additional dependencies
   - Familiar React patterns
   - Easy to understand and debug

2. Performance
   - Fine-grained control over re-renders
   - No external state management overhead
   - Direct optimization possibilities

3. Maintainability
   - Standard React practices
   - Easy onboarding for React developers
   - Clear data flow

### Negative

1. Potential scaling issues
   - Prop drilling in deep component trees
   - Complex state updates across components
   - Manual optimization needed

2. Future refactoring
   - May need external state management later
   - Potential component restructuring
   - Migration effort if patterns change

## Notes

- Monitor component re-render performance
- Document state management patterns
- Consider external state management when:
  - Prop drilling becomes excessive
  - State updates become complex
  - Team size grows significantly
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
