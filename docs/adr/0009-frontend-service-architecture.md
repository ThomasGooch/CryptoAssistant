# 9. Frontend Service Architecture

Date: 2025-05-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

AkashTrends frontend needs to:
- Communicate with backend REST APIs
- Handle real-time WebSocket connections
- Manage technical indicator calculations
- Maintain clean separation of concerns
- Enable code reuse across components

## Decision

We have decided to implement a service-based architecture:

1. Core Services
   - cryptoService: Handles cryptocurrency API calls
   - indicatorService: Manages technical indicator operations
   - signalRService: Controls real-time communication

2. Service Principles
   - Singleton instances
   - TypeScript interfaces for type safety
   - Clear error handling patterns
   - Consistent API structure

3. Service Responsibilities
   - Data fetching and caching
   - WebSocket connection management
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Data transformation and formatting

4. Integration Pattern
   - Services exposed through custom hooks
   - Centralized configuration
   - Consistent error handling
   - Typed responses

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Code Organization
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Reusable service logic
   - Consistent API patterns

2. Maintainability
   - Centralized API handling
   - Single responsibility principle
   - Easy to test and mock

3. Scalability
   - Easy to add new services
   - Consistent patterns across services
   - Clear integration points

### Negative

1. Additional Abstraction
   - More files to manage
   - Learning curve for service patterns
   - Potential over-abstraction

2. Service Management
   - Need to manage service lifecycles
   - Potential memory leaks if not careful
   - Configuration complexity

## Notes

- Document service patterns and usage
- Maintain consistent error handling
- Consider service worker integration
- Monitor service performance
- Keep services focused and single-purpose
