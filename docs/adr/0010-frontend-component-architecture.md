# 10. Frontend Component Architecture

Date: 2025-05-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

AkashTrends needs a scalable and maintainable component architecture that:
- Promotes code reuse
- Maintains clear separation of concerns
- Enables efficient testing
- Supports future growth
- Follows React best practices

## Decision

We have decided to implement a feature-based component architecture:

1. Directory Structure
   - components/
     - common/ (shared components)
     - crypto/ (cryptocurrency-specific components)
     - indicators/ (technical indicator components)

2. Component Types
   - Display Components: Pure UI rendering
   - Container Components: Business logic and state
   - Layout Components: Page structure
   - Common Components: Reusable UI elements

3. Component Principles
   - Single Responsibility
   - Props Interface Definition
   - Explicit Error Boundaries
   - Consistent Naming Convention

4. Testing Strategy
   - Unit Tests for Logic
   - Integration Tests for Containers
   - Snapshot Tests for UI
   - Accessibility Testing

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Organization
   - Clear component responsibilities
   - Easy to locate components
   - Logical grouping by feature

2. Development
   - Consistent patterns
   - Reusable components
   - Easy to test

3. Maintenance
   - Isolated feature changes
   - Clear dependencies
   - Easy to refactor

### Negative

1. Structure Overhead
   - More directories to manage
   - Need to decide component placement
   - Potential for duplication

2. Development Discipline
   - Must maintain conventions
   - Regular refactoring needed
   - Documentation overhead

## Notes

- Review component structure regularly
- Document component patterns
- Monitor component size and complexity
- Consider extracting common components
- Maintain consistent styling approach
- Keep accessibility in mind
